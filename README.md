## üé¨ About

This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Netflix dataset, which includes information on TV shows and movies available up to 2021. The analysis is conducted within a Jupyter Notebook (`NetflixAnalysis.ipynb`) and leverages Python libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn for data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset was sourced from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine, and is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows).

It features the following columns:

* `Show_Id`
* `Category` (Movie/TV Show)
* `Title`
* `Director`
* `Cast`
* `Country`
* `Release_Date`
* `Rating`
* `Duration`
* `Type` (Genre)
* `Description`

## üîç Key Analyses & Questions Answered

The notebook performs several data cleaning and analysis tasks to uncover insights from the dataset.

1.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
    * Handling of duplicate entries.
    * Detection and visualization of null values using a heatmap.
    * Creation of new features (like `Year` from `Release_Date`) for better analysis.

2.  **Exploratory Analysis:**
    * What was the year with the most content releases?
    * What is the breakdown of movies vs. TV shows?
    * Who are the top 10 directors with the most content on Netflix?
    * What are the different content ratings available?
    * Which country has produced the most TV shows?
    * What is the maximum duration of a movie on the platform?

## ‚ú® Visualizations

The analysis includes several visualizations to represent the findings, such as the distribution of content releases over the years.
